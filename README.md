# AI-Powered Freshness Detection for Fruits and Vegetables

## Project Overview
Food waste and spoilage are major global challenges, impacting both the economy and public health. This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for **automatic detection of freshness in fruits and vegetables**. By leveraging the strengths of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for spatial feature extraction and **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM)** for modeling temporal or sequential changes, the system can accurately classify produce as **Fresh**, **Semi-Fresh**, or **Spoiled**.

By combining image-based analysis with sequence modeling, the system handles **multi-view or time-lapse data**, enabling more robust and reliable freshness detection. This approach contributes to **reducing food waste**, **improving consumer safety**, and advancing hybrid CNNâ€“Bi-LSTM architectures in agricultural applications.

## Features
- Automatic classification of fruits and vegetables into freshness categories.
- Hybrid **CNN + Bi-LSTM** model for spatial and temporal feature analysis.
- Support for **multi-view and time-lapse datasets**.
- Robust and scalable solution for real-world applications in retail, supply chain, and home use.
- Use of public datasets like **Fruits-360** and **Kaggle Fresh/Rotten Fruits & Vegetables** for training and evaluation.
